## About This Site

VUE Books Catalog is a ready-to-run book catalog site. The project was created to demonstrate how easily a VUE project hosted in a GitHub repository can be integrated and instantly publish changes from the repository to the books.co.pl site using Netlify (continuous integration). My goal was to create a simple VUE application without a prepared backend. Books information is stored in a single JSON file (you can easily change this to using backend endpoints if you want). 

This project uses a VUE 3 with vuetify. You can see working site at [books.co.pl](https://books.co.pl)
